# What can Computers do:
## Math
- The computer already knows how to do simple arithmetic.
	- Additions, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division
- You can print the result of any math operation in an IDE that you may install.
- It may seem useless, but it comes in handy exceptionally often.
- An example
	- Building a Calculator App
		- We'd need to utilize this functionality to correctly display the answer to an arithmetic problem.
## Modulus
- Most programming languages have an additional operator known as modulus.
	- Represented with %
- Allows us to get the remainder of a divisional operation.
- When we take 10 % 3.
	- We tell the computer to divide 10 % by 3 and get an answer of 1.
- In the case where there isn't a remainder.
	- The computer will print/return 0.
### Evens and Odds
- This is extremely useful when determining if a number is even or odd.
	- If a number modulo 2 is 0 → The number is even.
	- If a number module 2 is 1 → The number is odd.
### Strings
- Strings are another way of saying text.
	- "Hello world"
	- "A"
	- **Anything enclosed by quotation marks** is denoted as a String.
	- Example of concatenation (Adding strings together)
		- print("Game over, " + 4 + "was your final score. ")
- 4 in quotation marks ("4") is treated as a STRING.
- 4 without quotation marks (4) is treated as an INTEGER.
