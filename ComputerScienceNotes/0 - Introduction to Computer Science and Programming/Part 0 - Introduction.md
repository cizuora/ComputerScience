# Introduction

👋🏿 Hello my name is Chidera Izuora
- I am a Computer Science Student.
## This is an introduction to programming and computer science
I plan to document my progress and failure to become a full-stack developer. 
Firstly, I started with this YouTube video https://youtu.be/zOjov-2OZ0E
This will reference significant points that apply to any language I want to learn or work with. 
- This will be used to document and help keep track of progress on what I have learned.
### We can move to Part 1: What is programming?
