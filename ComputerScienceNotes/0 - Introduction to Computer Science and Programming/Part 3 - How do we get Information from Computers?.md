### The Console
- Programmers keep track of their progress by looking at the [[console]].
	- A text interface within the computer that we programmers can use for a variety of purposes.
- The primary use of the [[console]] is to output text from the program using code.
	- More specifically, a print statement
		- Prints text to the console for the programmers' viewing pleasure
- Using the print statement
	- To use the print statement, simply instruct the console to print and include whatever you want to print inside the parenthesis.
		- Using [[Python]], we can print to the console like:

	- A print statement is also used to view and interpret the computer's output from a program.
		- Example: computing 4+3 will print nothing to the console, but if we say print computing, the console will show 7.
- The print statement will vary depending on the language.
	- For example, in Java, there are multiple versions of the print statement, depending on whether you want a line break.

- A Background Tool
	- The console is mainly a Developer Tool.
		- It is not usually meant to be used and interacted with by the end-user except in abstract cases.
	- Tends to be hidden away behind the scenes
	- Don't try to implement the console in the final product.
