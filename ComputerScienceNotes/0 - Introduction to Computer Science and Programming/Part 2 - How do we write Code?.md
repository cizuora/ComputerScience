### IDE's
- To properly send instructions to the computer, we need programming languages.
	- But we also can't type in a specific language and expect the same thing.
- We use IDE's (Integrated Development Environments) to write code.
	- A place to write, run, and debug code and also convert it to [[machine code]].
- IDE's are like any other program on your computer except used for the facilitation of code
	- Examples (Netbeans, IntelliJ, Visual Studios)
- In addition to a place to write code, IDE's also include
	- Built-in **Error-checking**.
		- For when code doesn't go right
	- Auto-fill for frequently used words.
	- Project Hierarchy
- A big step up from previously used methods of programming.
- Usually, it has a central area for writing code.
	- Additional windows include one for a console, project hierarchy, preview screens, etc.
- Another point is that each language has rules you must follow within an IDE.
	- You can't simply type rubbish in an IDE, convert it to [[machine code]], and expect the computer to understand it. You need syntax.
##### Learning Languages
- Learning a computer language can be very similar to learning an actual language.
	- **ALL** Programming languages have a set of rules you must follow when writing code in that language, just like in real languages.
		- In computer science, it is called [[Syntax]].
	- Similar to grammar in real-life languages.
###### What's [[Syntax]]?
- [[Syntax]]  - Rules you must follow to a tee if you want your program to run correctly
	- How do you type out certain functions?
	- What do you put at the end of each line of code?
	- How do you set up certain functions?
- The [[Syntax]] for each programming language is **unique**.
- Breaking programming rules will result in an **error**.
**Variable Examples**
- An examples. Let's initialize a variable in Java, Python, and JavaScript.
	- We haven't covered [[variables]], but they hold information.
- We must follow different rules to complete the same task in each.

- As you see in just this simple example, [[syntax]] matters when learning a new language.
- The program's goal was the same, but all three languages shown took different approaches.
- If you forget one semicolon or misplace a character, the entire program will not run and send you back a syntax error.
	- This is similar to forgetting a comma in an English sentence and the entire context of your statement being misinterpreted.

- Another cool feature of IDEs is that they will notify you if and when your code has syntax errors.
	- Parts of your code that do not follow the programming language rules.
