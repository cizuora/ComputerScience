## Variable Basics
- Each [[variable]] has a type, a name, and a piece of information stored inside of it.
	- The name is simply a name for the [[variable]].
### Types of Variables
- Many types of variables, but we will be focusing on primitive-type variables.
	- Integers, booleans, floats, doubles, Strings, and Chars.
- Integer's
	- A [[variable]] that can store and Integer value
		- -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,648
	- CAN'T and WILL NOT hold any decimal values.
- Booleans
	- It can store a value of either true or false.
	- It can ONLY hold true or false.
		- No other types of information.
- Floats and Doubles
	- Both are types of floating point data types.
		- Can store numbers with decimal places
	- Float [[variables]]
		- It can store up to 32 bits of information.
	- Double [[variables]]
		- It can store up to 64 bits of information.
- Strings
	- What we talked about before, except stored somewhere in a [[variable]].
	- Useful for displaying text and storing input information
		- Information the user puts into our program
	- Also useful for outputting information in a readable format for the user.
	- For example:
		- Prompt the user for their name.
		- We then store the value(user name) inside of the "Name" variable.
- Char's
	- Char â†’ Character
	- Each holds one character.
	- Useful when a programmer wants to read one button press of one character in a string without using a String variable
		- Example: Game controlled by keyboard
	- You can store char's in a String variable, but not Strings longer than one character in a char [[variable]].
- Why are [[variables]] useful?
	- You will often want to keep track of things such as a user's name or score.
		- By creating a variable, you can store this information in that variable and then reference, add to, or modify it.
	- Other important uses for variables
		- Taking input from the user
		- Making your program have variability
			- Have it change based on certain factors.
		- Manipulating variables is necessary for many tasks in programming.
