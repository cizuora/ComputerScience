## What is programming:
### Dictionary Definition
- [[Programming]]
	- The process of preparing an instruction program for a device.

### Layman's Term
- [[Programming]]
	- Attempting to get a computer to complete a **specific task** without making mistakes.
- Example:
	- You instruct your **less experienced** friend to build a Lego set.
		- He lost the instructions, so he can only build based on **your commands**.
	- Your friend is FAR less experienced in this field than you are, so you must give him **EXACT** instructions on how to build.
		- If even **one** piece is wrong, the entire Lego set will be ruined.
	- Replace the less experienced friend with someone who knows nothing and can't do anything without specific instructions. This is what a computer is, and we code by giving it specific instructions.
- Computers are only **smart** because we programmers program them to accomplish specific tasks for humans.

- Computers only understand [[machine code]]:
	- A series of 1's and 0's fed and interpreted by the computer.
	- A computer can only read English instructions by converting your English instructions to machine code. 
	- Therefore, the first step in talking to your computer is translating your English instructions into [[Binary]].
	- It would be impractical to convert every programming instruction into binary by hand, so we use a [[Programming Language]].
### Programming Language
- [[Programming Language]] serves as a middle-man of sorts.
- Translate your instructions into [[machine code]]:
	- The series of 0's and 1's that the computer can understand
- Very useful for programmers

- Programming Languages serve as **interpreters** for turning programmer's instructions into [[machine code]] for the computer.
- Each [[Programming Language]] is unique in how it operates.
	- [[Java]] and [[Python]] - General-purpose languages
	- [[HTML]]/[[CSS]] - Designed for specific tasks
		- In this case, web page design
- Each language also varies in how powerful it is
	- [[Javascript]] isn't used for big problems.
	-  [[Java]] and [[Python]] are used for big problems.
#### High vs Low-Level programming language
- Each language also has an attribute known as [[power]] or [[level]].
	- Basically, how similar is it to machine code.
- **Low-level** programming languages
	- Assembly or C
- **High-Level** programming languages
	- [[Java]] or [[Python]]
- Lower the level â†’ More similar to machine code.
